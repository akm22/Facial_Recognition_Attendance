# Facial_Recognition_Attendance

Through the Facial Recognition Attendance Software, I orchestrated the creation of a cutting-edge Python-based solution, leveraging my proficiency in Python programming and integration of external libraries. This project aimed at revolutionizing attendance tracking in university classrooms through the application of facial recognition technology.

Key Technical Contributions:

Advanced Libraries: Demonstrated expertise in utilizing external libraries, including face_recognition, cv2 (OpenCV), and numpy, to implement facial recognition algorithms and process real-time video input from webcams.

Custom Database Integration: Engineered a dynamic system capable of managing a growing database of known individuals, allowing for seamless additions of students and faculty members for future use.

User Interface Design: Developed an intuitive user interface using OpenCV for webcam integration, providing a real-time display of recognized faces, names, and timestamps for enhanced user interaction and monitoring.

Attendance Logging: Implemented an automated CSV file system for logging attendance details, showcasing skills in file manipulation and data organization.

Security Measures: Incorporated facial comparison techniques, ensuring accurate identification and minimizing false positives for enhanced system reliability.
